                  is not yet fully elucidated. We report a
                  high-throughput sequence of the human transcriptome
                  from a human embryonic kidney and a B cell line. We
                  used shotgun sequencing of transcripts to generate
                  randomly distributed reads.  Of these, 50\% mapped
                  to unique genomic locations, of which 80\%
                  corresponded to known exons. We found that 66\% of
                  the polyadenylated transcriptome mapped to known
                  genes and 34\% to nonannotated genomic regions. On
                  the basis of known transcripts, RNA-Seq can detect
                  25\% more genes than can microarrays. A global
                  survey of messenger RNA splicing events identified
                  94,241 splice junctions (4096 of which were
                  previously unidentified) and showed that exon
                  skipping is the most prevalent form of alternative

                  genes vary in copy number between any two
                  individuals and find that these genic differences
                  overwhelmingly correspond to segmental duplications
                  (odds ratio = 135; P < 2.2 x 10(-16)). Our method
                  can distinguish between different copies of highly
                  identical genes, providing a more accurate
                  assessment of gene content and insight into
                  functional constraint without the limitations of
                  array-based technology.},

                  calls for controlling the familywise error rate
                  (FWER). This approach, though, has faults, and we
                  point out a few. A different approach to problems of
                  multiple significance testing is presented. It calls
                  for controlling the expected proportion of falsely
                  rejected hypotheses-the false discovery rate.  This
                  error rate is equivalent to the FWER when all
                  hypotheses are true but is smaller
                  otherwise. Therefore, in problems where the control
                  of the false discovery rate rather than that of the
                  FWER is desired, there is potential for a gain in
                  power. A simple sequential Bonferroni-type procedure
                  is proved to control the false discovery rate for
                  independent test statistics, and a simulation study
                  shows that the gain in power is substantial. The use
                  of the new procedure and the appropriateness of the
                  criterion are illustrated with examples.},

                  fragment count (read coverage) and GC content found
                  in Illumina sequencing data. This bias can dominate
                  the signal of interest for analyses that focus on
                  measuring fragment abundance within a genome, such
                  as copy number estimation (DNA-seq). The bias is not
                  consistent between samples; and there is no
                  consensus as to the best methods to remove it in a
                  single sample. We analyze regularities in the GC
                  bias patterns, and find a compact description for
                  this unimodal curve family. It is the GC content of
                  the full DNA fragment, not only the sequenced read,
                  that most influences fragment count. This GC effect
                  is unimodal: both GC-rich fragments and AT-rich
                  fragments are underrepresented in the sequencing
                  results. This empirical evidence strengthens the
                  hypothesis that PCR is the most important cause of
                  the GC bias. We propose a model that produces
                  predictions at the base pair level, allowing
                  strand-specific GC-effect correction regardless of
                  the downstream smoothing or binning. These GC
                  modeling considerations can inform other

                  important role for natural selection in shaping gene
                  expression patterns within and between species. Most
                  of these studies, however, estimated gene expression
                  levels using microarray probes designed to hybridize
                  to only a small proportion of each gene. Here, we
                  used recently developed RNA sequencing protocols,
                  which sidestep this limitation, to assess intra- and
                  interspecies variation in gene regulatory processes
                  in considerably more detail than was previously
                  possible. Specifically, we used RNA-seq to study
                  transcript levels in humans, chimpanzees, and rhesus
                  macaques, using liver RNA samples from three males
                  and three females from each species.  Our approach
                  allowed us to identify a large number of genes whose
                  expression levels likely evolve under natural
                  selection in primates.  These include a subset of
                  genes with conserved sexually dimorphic expression
                  patterns across the three species, which we found to
                  be enriched for genes involved in lipid
                  metabolism. Our data also suggest that while
                  alternative splicing is tightly regulated within and
                  between species, sex-specific and lineage-specific
                  changes in the expression of different splice forms
                  are also frequent. Intriguingly, among genes in
                  which a change in exon usage occurred exclusively in
                  the human lineage, we found an enrichment of genes
                  involved in anatomical structure and morphogenesis,
                  raising the possibility that differences in the
                  regulation of alternative splicing have been an
                  important force in human evolution.},

                  density oligonucleotide arrays, it is important to
                  remove sources of variation between arrays of
                  non-biological origin. Normalization is a process
                  for reducing this variation. It is common to see
                  non-linear relations between arrays and the standard
                  normalization provided by Affymetrix does not
                  perform well in these situations.We present three
                  methods of performing normalization at the probe
                  intensity level. These methods are called complete
                  data methods because they make use of data from all
                  arrays in an experiment to form the normalizing
                  relation. These algorithms are compared to two
                  methods that make use of a baseline array: a one
                  number scaling based algorithm and a method that
                  uses a non-linear normalizing relation by comparing
                  the variability and bias of an expression
                  measure. Two publicly available datasets are used to
                  carry out the comparisons. The simplest and quickest
                  complete data method is found to perform

                  sequencing of complementary DNA. Nucleic Acids
                  Res.37(18), e123], which has been recently reviewed
                  as the leading protocol for strand-specific RNA-Seq
                  library preparation [Levin, J. Z., Yassour, M.,
                  Adiconis, X., Nusbaum, C., Thompson, D. A.,

                  strand-specific RNA sequencing
                  methods. Nat. Methods7(9), 709-715]. The procedure
                  starts with the isolation of the polyA fraction
                  (mRNA) within a pool of total RNA, followed by its
                  fragmentation. Then double-stranded (ds) cDNA
                  synthesis is performed with the incorporation of
                  dUTP in the second strand. The ds cDNA fragments are
                  further processed following a standard sequencing
                  library preparation scheme tailored for the Illumina
                  sequencing platform: end polishing, A-tailing,
                  adapter ligation, and size selection. Prior to final
                  amplification, the dUTP-marked strand is selectively
                  degraded by Uracil-DNA-Glycosylase (UDG). The
                  remaining strand is amplified to generate a cDNA
                  library suitable for sequencing.},

  abstract =	 {C57BL/6J (B6) and DBA/2J (D2) are two of the most
                  commonly used inbred mouse strains in neuroscience
                  research. However, the only currently available
                  mouse genome is based entirely on the B6 strain
                  sequence.  Subsequently, oligonucleotide microarray
                  probes are based solely on this B6 reference
                  sequence, making their application for gene
                  expression profiling comparisons across mouse
                  strains dubious due to their allelic sequence
                  differences, including single nucleotide
                  polymorphisms (SNPs). The emergence of
                  next-generation sequencing (NGS) and the RNA-Seq
                  application provides a clear alternative to
                  oligonucleotide arrays for detecting differential
                  gene expression without the problems inherent to
                  hybridization-based technologies.  Using RNA-Seq, an
                  average of 22 million short sequencing reads were
                  generated per sample for 21 samples (10 B6 and 11
                  D2), and these reads were aligned to the mouse
                  reference genome, allowing 16,183 Ensembl genes to
                  be queried in striatum for both strains. To
                  determine differential expression, 'digital mRNA
                  counting' is applied based on reads that map to
                  exons. The current study compares RNA-Seq (Illumina
                  GA IIx) with two microarray platforms (Illumina
                  MouseRef-8 v2.0 and Affymetrix MOE 430 2.0) to
                  detect differential striatal gene expression between
                  the B6 and D2 inbred mouse strains. We show that by
                  using stringent data processing requirements
                  differential expression as determined by RNA-Seq is
                  concordant with both the Affymetrix and Illumina
                  platforms in more instances than it is concordant
                  with only a single platform, and that instances of
                  discordance with respect to direction of fold change
                  were rare. Finally, we show that additional
                  information is gained from RNA-Seq compared to
                  hybridization-based techniques as RNA-Seq detects
                  more genes than either microarray platform.  The
                  majority of genes differentially expressed in
                  RNA-Seq were only detected as present in RNA-Seq,
                  which is important for studies with smaller effect
                  sizes where the sensitivity of hybridization-based
                  techniques could bias interpretation.},

                  from the massive and complex datasets generated by
                  the sequencers. We provide a detailed evaluation of
                  statistical methods for normalization and
                  differential expression (DE) analysis of Illumina
                  transcriptome sequencing (mRNA-Seq) data.We compare
                  statistical methods for detecting genes that are
                  significantly DE between two types of biological
                  samples and find that there are substantial
                  differences in how the test statistics handle
                  low-count genes. We evaluate how DE results are
                  affected by features of the sequencing platform,
                  such as, varying gene lengths, base-calling
                  calibration method (with and without phi X control
                  lane), and flow-cell/library preparation effects. We
                  investigate the impact of the read count
                  normalization method on DE results and show that the
                  standard approach of scaling by total lane counts
                  (e.g., RPKM) can bias estimates of DE. We propose
                  more general quantile-based normalization procedures
                  and demonstrate an improvement in DE detection.Our

                  methodological implications for the design and

                  importance of appropriate statistical methods for
                  normalization and DE inference, to account for
                  features of the sequencing platform that could
                  impact the accuracy of results. They also reveal the

                  tools to provide efficient mapping for different
                  read lengths and sequencing technologies. In
                  particular, ABI's sequencer (SOLiD system) poses a
                  big computational challenge with its capacity to
                  produce very large amounts of data, and its unique
                  strategy of encoding sequence data into color
                  signals.We present the mapping software, named PerM
                  (Periodic Seed Mapping) that uses periodic spaced
                  seeds to significantly improve mapping efficiency
                  for large reference genomes when compared with
                  state-of-the-art programs.  The data structure in
                  PerM requires only 4.5 bytes per base to index the

                  periodic seeds offer full sensitivity for up to

                  genomes, but are still relatively
                  under-ascertained. Here we use tiling
                  oligonucleotide microarrays, comprising 42 million
                  probes, to generate a comprehensive map of 11,700
                  copy number variations (CNVs) greater than 443 base
                  pairs, of which most (8,599) have been validated
                  independently. For 4,978 of these CNVs, we generated
                  reference genotypes from 450 individuals of
                  European, African or East Asian ancestry. The
                  predominant mutational mechanisms differ among CNV

                  assessed the completeness of our map and the
                  patterns of linkage disequilibrium between CNVs and
                  SNPs, we conclude that, for complex traits, the
                  heritability void left by genome-wide association
                  studies will not be accounted for by common CNVs.},

                  populations, and sequenced ten 100-kilobase regions
                  in 692 of these individuals. This integrated data
                  set of common and rare alleles, called 'HapMap 3',
                  includes both SNPs and copy number polymorphisms
                  (CNPs). We characterized population-specific
                  differences among low-frequency variants, measured
                  the improvement in imputation accuracy afforded by
                  the larger reference panel, especially in imputing
                  SNPs with a minor allele frequency of <or=5\%, and
                  demonstrated the feasibility of imputing newly
                  discovered CNPs and SNPs. This expanded public
                  resource of genome variants in global populations
                  supports deeper interrogation of genomic variation
                  and its role in human disease, and serves as a step
                  towards a high-resolution map of the landscape of
                  human genetic variation.},

                  dramatically changed the landscape of the genetics

                  genome nucleotide variations are only some of the
                  intriguing new applications supported by these
                  innovative platforms. Among them RNA-Seq is perhaps
                  the most complex NGS application. Expression levels
                  of specific genes, differential splicing,
                  allele-specific expression of transcripts can be
                  accurately determined by RNA-Seq experiments to
                  address many biological-related issues. All these
                  attributes are not readily achievable from
                  previously widespread hybridization-based or tag
                  sequence-based approaches. However, the
                  unprecedented level of sensitivity and the large

                  provide clear advantages as well as new challenges
                  and issues. This technology brings the great power
                  to make several new biological observations and
                  discoveries, it also requires a considerable effort
                  in the development of new bioinformatics tools to
                  deal with these massive data files. The paper aims
                  to give a survey of the RNA-Seq methodology,
                  particularly focusing on the challenges that this
                  application presents both from a biological and a

                  alterations and structural rearrangements.  A
                  powerful way to discover cancer-causing genes is to
                  identify genomic regions that show recurrent
                  copy-number alterations (gains and losses) in tumor
                  genomes. The analysis of copy-number alterations has
                  traditionally been performed by using DNA
                  microarrays, but recent advances in sequencing
                  technologies suggest that random shotgun sequencing
                  may provide a powerful alternative. Here, we present
                  (i) a statistical analysis of the power to detect
                  copy-number alterations of a given size; (ii) an
                  algorithm to identify breakpoints, using massively
                  parallel sequence data; and (iii) analysis of
                  experimental data from three matched pairs of tumor
                  and normal cell lines. We show that a collection of
                  10 million shotgun sequence reads has comparable
                  power to detect events as the current generation of
                  DNA microarrays and has considerably better power to
                  localize breakpoints (typically, to within ~1 kb).
                  Our experimental analysis confirms these analytical
                  predictions.  As sequencing costs continue to drop,
                  massively parallel sequencing will be increasingly
                  feasible and will likely become the preferred
                  approach for analyzing cancer genomes. },

                  technologies are likely to revolutionize genetics
                  and biomedical research, but a thorough
                  characterization of the ultra-short read output is
                  necessary. We generated and analyzed two Illumina 1G
                  ultra-short read data sets, i.e. 2.8 million 27mer
                  reads from a Beta vulgaris genomic clone and 12.3
                  million 36mers from the Helicobacter acinonychis
                  genome. We found that error rates range from 0.3\%
                  at the beginning of reads to 3.8\% at the end of
                  reads. Wrong base calls are frequently preceded by
                  base G. Base substitution error frequencies vary by
                  10- to 11-fold, with A > C transversion being among
                  the most frequent and C > G transversions among the
                  least frequent substitution errors. Insertions and
                  deletions of single bases occur at very low
                  rates. When simulating re-sequencing we found a
                  20-fold sequencing coverage to be sufficient to
                  compensate errors by correct reads. The read
                  coverage of the sequenced regions is biased; the
                  highest read density was found in intervals with
                  elevated GC content. High Solexa quality scores are
                  over-optimistic and low scores underestimate the
                  data quality. Our results show different types of
                  biases and ways to detect them. Such biases have
                  implications on the use and interpretation of Solexa
                  data, for de novo sequencing, re-sequencing, the
                  identification of single nucleotide polymorphisms

                  reads.  Using the Myrna package, reads were aligned,
                  overlapped with gene models and tabulated into
                  gene-by-sample count tables that are ready for
                  statistical analysis. Count tables and phenotype
                  data were combined into Bioconductor ExpressionSet
                  objects for ease of analysis. ReCount also contains
                  the Myrna manifest files and R source code used to
                  process the samples, allowing statistical and
                  computational scientists to consider alternative
                  parameter values. 3By combining datasets from many
                  studies and providing data that has already been
                  processed from. fastq format into
                  ready-to-use. RData and. txt files, ReCount
                  facilitates analysis and methods development for
                  RNA-seq count data.  We anticipate that ReCount will
                  also be useful for investigators who wish to
                  consider cross-study comparisons and alternative
                  normalization strategies for RNA-seq.},

                  comparison. The ROC includes elements of both
                  sensitivity and specificity, and is a quantitative
                  measure of the usefulness of a diagnostic.  The ROC
                  is used in this work to investigate the effects of
                  scoring table and gap penalties on database
                  searches. Studies on three families of proteins,
                  4Fe-4S ferredoxins, lysR bacterial regulatory
                  proteins, and bacterial RNA polymerase sigma-factors
                  lead to the following conclusions: sequence families
                  are quite idiosyncratic, but the best PAM distance
                  for database searches using the Smith-Waterman
                  method is somewhat larger than predicted by
                  theoretical methods, about 200 PAM. The length
                  independent gap penalty (gap initiation penalty) is
                  quite important, but shows a broad peak at values of
                  about 20-24.  The length dependent gap penalty (gap
                  extension penalty) is almost irrelevant suggesting
                  that successful database searches rely only to a
                  limited degree on gapped alignments. Taken together,
                  these observations lead to the conclusion that the

                  searches are not, and should not be expected to be,

  abstract =	 {BACKGROUND: Next-generation sequencing technologies
                  have been applied most often to model organisms or
                  species closely related to a model.  However, these
                  methods have the potential to be valuable in many
                  wild organisms, including those of conservation
                  concern. We used Roche 454 pyrosequencing to
                  characterize gene expression in polyploid lake
                  sturgeon (Acipenser fulvescens) gonads. RESULTS:
                  Titration runs on a Roche 454 GS-FLX produced more
                  than 47,000 sequencing reads.  These reads
                  represented 20,741 unique sequences that passed
                  quality control (mean length = 186 bp). These were
                  assembled into 1,831 contigs (mean contig depth =
                  4.1 sequences). Over 4,000 sequencing reads
                  (approximately 19\%) were assigned gene ontologies,
                  mostly to protein, RNA, and ion binding. A total of
                  877 candidate SNPs were identified from > 50
                  different genes. We employed an analytical approach
                  from theoretical ecology (rarefaction) to evaluate
                  depth of sequencing coverage relative to gene
                  discovery. We also considered the relative merits of
                  normalized versus native cDNA libraries when using
                  next-generation sequencing platforms. Not
                  surprisingly, fewer genes from the normalized
                  libraries were rRNA subunits. Rarefaction suggests
                  that normalization has little influence on the
                  efficiency of gene discovery, at least when working
                  with thousands of reads from a single tissue
                  type. CONCLUSION: Our data indicate that titration
                  runs on 454 sequencers can characterize thousands of
                  expressed sequence tags which can be used to
                  identify SNPs, gene ontologies, and levels of gene
                  expression in species of conservation concern. We
                  anticipate that rarefaction will be useful in
                  evaluations of gene discovery and that
                  next-generation sequencing technologies hold great
                  potential for the study of other non-model
                  organisms.},

                  genome-wide scale is one of the most promising
                  accomplishments in molecular biology. Microarrays,
                  the technology that first permitted this, were
                  riddled with problems due to unwanted sources of
                  variability. Many of these problems are now
                  mitigated, after a decade's worth of statistical
                  methodology development. The recently developed RNA
                  sequencing (RNA-seq) technology has generated much
                  excitement in part due to claims of reduced
                  variability in comparison to microarrays. However,
                  we show that RNA-seq data demonstrate unwanted and
                  obscuring variability similar to what was first
                  observed in microarrays. In particular, we find
                  guanine-cytosine content (GC-content) has a strong
                  sample-specific effect on gene expression
                  measurements that, if left uncorrected, leads to
                  false positives in downstream results. We also
                  report on commonly observed data distortions that
                  demonstrate the need for data normalization.  Here,
                  we describe a statistical methodology that improves
                  precision by 42\% without loss of accuracy. Our
                  resulting conditional quantile normalization
                  algorithm combines robust generalized regression to
                  remove systematic bias introduced by deterministic
                  features such as GC-content and quantile
                  normalization to correct for global distortions.},

                  patterns of differential expression in order to take
                  these forward for further analysis and validation.We
                  propose a framework for defining patterns of
                  differential expression and develop a novel
                  algorithm, baySeq, which uses an empirical Bayes
                  approach to detect these patterns of differential
                  expression within a set of sequencing samples. The
                  method assumes a negative binomial distribution for
                  the data and derives an empirically determined prior
                  distribution from the entire dataset. We examine the
                  performance of the method on real and simulated
                  data.Our method performs at least as well, and often
                  better, than existing methods for analyses of
                  pairwise differential expression in both real and
                  simulated data.  When we compare methods for the
                  analysis of data from experimental designs involving
                  multiple sample groups, our method again shows
                  substantial gains in performance. We believe that
                  this approach thus represents an important step
                  forward for the analysis of count data from
                  sequencing experiments.},

                  candidate genes or genomic intervals to perform
                  sequence-based association studies. To evaluate
                  these platforms for this application, we analyzed
                  human sequence generated by the Roche 454, Illumina
                  GA, and the ABI SOLiD technologies for the same 260
                  kb in four individuals.Local sequence
                  characteristics contribute to systematic variability
                  in sequence coverage (>100-fold difference in
                  per-base coverage), resulting in patterns for each
                  NGS technology that are highly correlated between
                  samples. A comparison of the base calls to 88 kb of
                  overlapping ABI 3730xL Sanger sequence generated for
                  the same samples showed that the NGS platforms all
                  have high sensitivity, identifying >95\% of variant

                  are systematic, resulting from local sequence
                  contexts; as the coverage is lowered additional
                  'random sampling' errors in base calling occur.Our

                  makes it possible for us to measure transcription at
                  an unprecedented precision and throughput. However,
                  challenges remain in understanding the source and
                  distribution of the reads, modeling the transcript
                  abundance and developing efficient computational
                  methods. In this article, we develop a method to
                  deal with the isoform expression estimation
                  problem. The count of reads falling into a locus on
                  the genome annotated with multiple isoforms is
                  modeled as a Poisson variable. The expression of
                  each individual isoform is estimated by solving a
                  convex optimization problem and statistical
                  inferences about the parameters are obtained from
                  the posterior distribution by importance
                  sampling. Our results show that isoform expression
                  inference in RNA-Seq is possible by employing
                  appropriate statistical methods.},

  abstract =	 {Antisense transcription (transcription from the
                  opposite strand to a protein-coding or sense strand)
                  has been ascribed roles in gene regulation involving
                  degradation of the corresponding sense transcripts
                  (RNA interference), as well as gene silencing at the
                  chromatin level.  Global transcriptome analysis
                  provides evidence that a large proportion of the

                  and that antisense transcripts commonly link
                  neighboring "genes" in complex loci into chains of
                  linked transcriptional units. Expression profiling

                  evidence that perturbation of an antisense RNA can

                  for accurately measuring gene expression
                  levels. Expression estimation with RNA-Seq requires
                  the mapping of relatively short sequencing reads to
                  a reference genome or transcript set. Because reads
                  are generally shorter than transcripts from which
                  they are derived, a single read may map to multiple
                  genes and isoforms, complicating expression
                  analyses. Previous computational methods either
                  discard reads that map to multiple locations or
                  allocate them to genes heuristically. RESULTS: We
                  present a generative statistical model and
                  associated inference methods that handle read
                  mapping uncertainty in a principled manner. Through
                  simulations parameterized by real RNA-Seq data, we
                  show that our method is more accurate than previous
                  methods. Our improved accuracy is the result of
                  handling read mapping uncertainty with a statistical
                  model and the estimation of gene expression levels
                  as the sum of isoform expression levels. Unlike
                  previous methods, our method is capable of modeling
                  non-uniform read distributions.  Simulations with
                  our method indicate that a read length of 20-25
                  bases is optimal for gene-level expression
                  estimation from mouse and maize RNA-Seq data when
                  sequencing throughput is fixed.},

  abstract =	 {The enormous amount of short reads generated by the
                  new DNA sequencing technologies call for the
                  development of fast and accurate read alignment
                  programs. A first generation of hash table-based
                  methods has been developed, including MAQ, which is
                  accurate, feature rich and fast enough to align
                  short reads from a single individual. However, MAQ
                  does not support gapped alignment for single-end
                  reads, which makes it unsuitable for alignment of
                  longer reads where indels may occur frequently. The
                  speed of MAQ is also a concern when the alignment is
                  scaled up to the resequencing of hundreds of
                  individuals.We implemented Burrows-Wheeler Alignment
                  tool (BWA), a new read alignment package that is
                  based on backward search with Burrows-Wheeler
                  Transform (BWT), to efficiently align short
                  sequencing reads against a large reference sequence
                  such as the human genome, allowing mismatches and
                  gaps.  BWA supports both base space reads, e.g. from
                  Illumina sequencing machines, and color space reads
                  from AB SOLiD machines. Evaluations on both
                  simulated and real data suggest that BWA is
                  approximately 10-20x faster than MAQ, while
                  achieving similar accuracy. In addition, BWA outputs
                  alignment in the new standard SAM (Sequence
                  Alignment/Map) format. Variant calling and other
                  downstream analyses after the alignment can be
                  achieved with the open source SAMtools software
                  package.http://maq.sourceforge.net.},

  abstract =	 {New sequencing technologies promise a new era in the
                  use of DNA sequence.  However, some of these
                  technologies produce very short reads, typically of
                  a few tens of base pairs, and to use these reads
                  effectively requires new algorithms and software. In
                  particular, there is a major issue in efficiently
                  aligning short reads to a reference genome and
                  handling ambiguity or lack of accuracy in this
                  alignment. Here we introduce the concept of mapping
                  quality, a measure of the confidence that a read
                  actually comes from the position it is aligned to by
                  the mapping algorithm. We describe the software MAQ
                  that can build assemblies by mapping shotgun short
                  reads to a reference genome, using quality scores to
                  derive genotype calls of the consensus sequence of a
                  diploid genome, e.g., from a human sample. MAQ makes
                  full use of mate-pair information and estimates the
                  error probability of each read alignment.  Error
                  probabilities are also derived for the final
                  genotype calls, using a Bayesian statistical model
                  that incorporates the mapping qualities, error
                  probabilities from the raw sequence quality scores,
                  sampling of the two haplotypes, and an empirical
                  model for correlated errors at a site. Both read
                  mapping and genotype calling are evaluated on
                  simulated data and real data. MAQ is accurate,
                  efficient, versatile, and user-friendly. It is
                  freely available at http://maq.sourceforge.net.},

                  (RNA-Seq) and other sequencing-based comparative
                  genomic experiments. RNA-Seq data takes the form of
                  counts, so models based on the normal distribution
                  are generally unsuitable.  The problem is especially
                  challenging because different sequencing experiments
                  may generate quite different total numbers of reads,
                  or 'sequencing depths'. Existing methods for this
                  problem are based on Poisson or negative binomial
                  models: they are useful but can be heavily
                  influenced by 'outliers' in the data. We introduce a
                  simple, non-parametric method with resampling to
                  account for the different sequencing depths. The new
                  method is more robust than parametric methods. It
                  can be applied to data with quantitative, survival,
                  two-class or multiple-class outcomes. We compare our

                  binomial-based methods in simulated and real data
                  sets, and find that our method discovers more

                  from a treated and an untreated sample were utilized
                  to generate RNA-seq libraries that were sequenced on
                  the Illumina GA1 analyzer.  Statistical analysis of
                  approximately ten million sequence reads generated
                  from both control and treated cells suggests that
                  this tag density is sufficient for quantitative

                  involving multiple serial analysis of gene
                  expression (SAGE) libraries, it is critical to
                  account for both between and within library
                  variation. Several methods have been proposed,
                  including the t test, tw test, and an overdispersed
                  logistic regression approach. The merits of these
                  tests, however, have not been fully
                  evaluated. Questions still remain on whether further
                  improvements can be made.In this article, we
                  introduce an overdispersed log-linear model approach
                  to analyzing SAGE; we evaluate and compare its
                  performance with three other tests: the two-sample t
                  test, tw test and another based on overdispersed
                  logistic linear regression. Analysis of simulated
                  and real datasets show that both the log-linear and
                  logistic overdispersion methods generally perform
                  better than the t and tw tests; the log-linear
                  method is further found to have better performance
                  than the logistic method, showing equal or higher
                  statistical power over a range of parameter values
                  and with different data distributions.Overdispersed
                  log-linear models provide an attractive and reliable
                  framework for analyzing SAGE experiments involving
                  multiple libraries. For convenience, the
                  implementation of this method is available through a

                  results obtained from Affymetrix arrays using the
                  same RNA samples. We find that the Illumina
                  sequencing data are highly replicable, with
                  relatively little technical variation, and thus, for
                  many purposes, it may suffice to sequence each mRNA
                  sample only once (i.e., using one lane). The
                  information in a single lane of Illumina sequencing
                  data appears comparable to that in a single array in
                  enabling identification of differentially expressed
                  genes, while allowing for additional analyses such
                  as detection of low-expressed genes, alternative
                  splice variants, and novel transcripts. Based on our
                  observations, we propose an empirical protocol and a
                  statistical framework for the analysis of gene
                  expression using ultra-high-throughput sequencing
                  technology.},

  abstract =	 {ABSTRACT: BACKGROUND: The generation and analysis of
                  high-throughput sequencing data are becoming a major
                  component of many studies in molecular biology and
                  medical research. Illumina's Genome Analyzer (GA)
                  and HiSeq instruments are currently the most widely
                  used sequencing devices. Here, we comprehensively
                  evaluate properties of genomic HiSeq and GAIIx data
                  derived from two plant genomes and one virus, with
                  read lengths of 95 to 150 bases. RESULTS: We provide
                  quantifications and evidence for GC bias, error
                  rates, error sequence context, effects of quality
                  filtering, and the reliability of quality values. By
                  combining different filtering criteria we reduced
                  error rates 7-fold at the expense of discarding
                  12.5\% of alignable bases. While overall error rates
                  are low in HiSeq data we observed regions of
                  accumulated wrong base calls. Only 3\% of all error
                  positions accounted for 24.7\% of all substitution
                  errors. Analyzing the forward and reverse strands
                  separately revealed error rates of up to
                  18.7\%. Insertions and deletions occurred at very
                  low rates on average but increased to up to 2\% in
                  homopolymers. A positive correlation between read
                  coverage and GC content was found depending on the
                  GC content range. CONCLUSIONS: The errors and biases
                  we report have implications for the use and the
                  interpretation of Illumina sequencing data. GAIIx
                  and HiSeq data sets show slightly different error
                  profiles. Quality filtering is essential to minimize
                  downstream analysis artifacts. Supporting previous
                  recommendations, the strand-specificity provides a
                  criterion to distinguish sequencing errors from low
                  abundance polymorphisms.},

  abstract =	 {Gene expression is an important phenotype that
                  informs about genetic and environmental effects on
                  cellular state. Many studies have previously
                  identified genetic variants for gene expression
                  phenotypes using custom and commercially available
                  microarrays. Second generation sequencing
                  technologies are now providing unprecedented access
                  to the fine structure of the transcriptome. We have
                  sequenced the mRNA fraction of the transcriptome in
                  60 extended HapMap individuals of European descent
                  and have combined these data with genetic variants
                  from the HapMap3 project. We have quantified exon
                  abundance based on read depth and have also
                  developed methods to quantify whole transcript
                  abundance. We have found that approximately 10
                  million reads of sequencing can provide access to
                  the same dynamic range as arrays with better
                  quantification of alternative and highly abundant
                  transcripts. Correlation with SNPs (small nucleotide
                  polymorphisms) leads to a larger discovery of eQTLs
                  (expression quantitative trait loci) than with
                  arrays. We also detect a substantial number of
                  variants that influence the structure of mature
                  transcripts indicating variants responsible for
                  alternative splicing. Finally, measures of
                  allele-specific expression allowed the
                  identification of rare eQTLs and allelic differences
                  in transcript structure. This analysis shows that
                  high throughput sequencing technologies reveal new
                  properties of genetic effects on the transcriptome
                  and allow the exploration of genetic effects in
                  cellular processes.},

                  of magnitude. Although >90\% of uniquely mapped

                  effectiveness of deep sequencing for transcriptome
                  analysis (RNA-seq) in mammals. As RNA-seq becomes
                  more affordable, whole genome transcriptional
                  profiling is likely to become the platform of choice
                  for species with good genomic sequences. As yet, a
                  rigorous analysis methodology has not been developed
                  and we are still in the stages of exploring the

                  using aggregated tag counts for each gene, the
                  ability to call differentially expressed genes
                  between samples is strongly associated with the
                  length of the transcript.Transcript length bias for
                  calling differentially expressed genes is a general
                  feature of current protocols for RNA-seq
                  technology. This has implications for the ranking of
                  differentially expressed genes, and in particular
                  may introduce bias in gene set testing for pathway
                  analysis and other multi-gene systems biology
                  analyses.This article was reviewed by Rohan Williams

                  and transcriptomes are increasingly done by deep DNA
                  sequencing methods (ChIP-seq and RNA-seq). The power
                  and richness of these counting-based measurements
                  comes at the cost of routinely handling tens to
                  hundreds of millions of reads. Whereas early
                  adopters necessarily developed their own custom
                  computer code to analyze the first ChIP-seq and
                  RNA-seq datasets, a new generation of more

                  natural variation in gene expression is a central
                  goal of both medical and evolutionary genetics, and
                  studies of expression quantitative trait loci
                  (eQTLs) have become an important tool for achieving
                  this goal. Although all eQTL studies so far have
                  assayed messenger RNA levels using expression
                  microarrays, recent advances in RNA sequencing
                  enable the analysis of transcript variation at
                  unprecedented resolution. We sequenced RNA from 69
                  lymphoblastoid cell lines derived from unrelated
                  Nigerian individuals that have been extensively
                  genotyped by the International HapMap Project. By
                  pooling data from all individuals, we generated a
                  map of the transcriptional landscape of these cells,
                  identifying extensive use of unannotated
                  untranslated regions and more than 100 new putative
                  protein-coding exons. Using the genotypes from the
                  HapMap project, we identified more than a thousand
                  genes at which genetic variation influences overall
                  expression levels or splicing. We demonstrate that
                  eQTLs near genes generally act by a mechanism
                  involving allele-specific expression, and that
                  variation that influences the inclusion of an exon
                  is enriched within and near the consensus splice
                  sites. Our results illustrate the power of
                  high-throughput sequencing for the joint analysis of
                  variation in transcription, splicing and
                  allele-specific expression across individuals.},

                  genomic features is a fundamental task in genomics
                  research. However, searching for overlaps between
                  features with existing web-based methods is
                  complicated by the massive datasets that are
                  routinely produced with current sequencing
                  technologies. Fast and flexible tools are therefore
                  required to ask complex questions of these data in
                  an efficient manner.This article introduces a new
                  software suite for the comparison, manipulation and
                  annotation of genomic features in Browser Extensible
                  Data (BED) and General Feature Format (GFF)
                  format. BEDTools also supports the comparison of
                  sequence alignments in BAM format to both BED and
                  GFF features. The tools are extremely efficient and
                  allow the user to compare large datasets
                  (e.g. next-generation sequencing data) with both
                  public and custom genome annotation tracks. BEDTools
                  can be combined with one another as well as with
                  standard UNIX commands, thus facilitating routine
                  genomics tasks as well as pipelines that can quickly

                  expression (DGE) technologies will overtake
                  microarray technologies in the near future for many
                  functional genomics applications. One of the
                  fundamental data analysis tasks, especially for gene
                  expression studies, involves determining whether
                  there is evidence that counts for a transcript or
                  exon are significantly different across experimental
                  conditions.  edgeR is a Bioconductor software
                  package for examining differential expression of
                  replicated count data. An overdispersed Poisson
                  model is used to account for both biological and
                  technical variability.  Empirical Bayes methods are
                  used to moderate the degree of overdispersion across
                  transcripts, improving the reliability of
                  inference. The methodology can be used even with the
                  most minimal levels of replication, provided at
                  least one phenotype or experimental condition is
                  replicated. The software may have other applications
                  beyond sequencing data, such as proteome peptide
                  count data. AVAILABILITY: The package is freely

                  sensitive technologies for measuring gene expression
                  on a genomic scale, without the need for prior
                  knowledge of the genome sequence. As the cost of
                  sequencing DNA decreases, the number of DGE datasets
                  is expected to grow dramatically. Various tests of

                  negative binomial or pseudo-likelihood (PL) models
                  for the counts, but none of the these are usable

                  database for proteins with distant similarity to a
                  query sequence. We investigated over a dozen
                  modifications to the methods used in PSI-BLAST, with
                  the goal of improving accuracy in finding true
                  positive matches. To evaluate performance we used a
                  set of 103 queries for which the true positives in
                  yeast had been annotated by human experts, and a
                  popular measure of retrieval accuracy (ROC) that can
                  be normalized to take on values between 0 (worst)
                  and 1 (best). The modifications we consider novel
                  improve the ROC score from 0.758 +/- 0.005 to 0.895
                  +/- 0.003. This does not include the benefits from
                  four modifications we included in the 'baseline'
                  version, even though they were not implemented in
                  PSI-BLAST version 2.0. The improvement in accuracy
                  was confirmed on a small second test set. This test
                  involved analyzing three protein families with
                  curated lists of true positives from the
                  non-redundant protein database. The modification
                  that accounts for the majority of the improvement is
                  the use, for each database sequence, of a
                  position-specific scoring system tuned to that
                  sequence's amino acid composition. The use of
                  composition-based statistics is particularly
                  beneficial for large-scale automated applications of
                  PSI-BLAST.},

                  performance measures that can be freely combined to

                  lift charts and cost curves. ROCR integrates tightly
                  with R's powerful graphics capabilities, thus
                  allowing for highly adjustable plots. Being equipped

                  revolutionizing genome research, and in particular,
                  their application to transcriptomics (RNA-seq) is
                  increasingly being used for gene expression
                  profiling as a replacement for microarrays. However,
                  the properties of RNA-seq data have not been yet
                  fully established, and additional research is needed
                  for understanding how these data respond to
                  differential expression analysis. In this work, we
                  set out to gain insights into the characteristics of
                  RNA-seq data analysis by studying an important
                  parameter of this technology: the sequencing
                  depth. We have analyzed how sequencing depth affects
                  the detection of transcripts and their
                  identification as differentially expressed, looking
                  at aspects such as transcript biotype, length,
                  expression level, and fold-change.  We have
                  evaluated different algorithms available for the
                  analysis of RNA-seq and proposed a novel
                  approach-NOISeq-that differs from existing methods
                  in that it is data-adaptive and nonparametric. Our
                  results reveal that most existing methodologies
                  suffer from a strong dependency on sequencing depth
                  for their differential expression calls and that
                  this results in a considerable number of false
                  positives that increases as the number of reads
                  grows. In contrast, our proposed method models the
                  noise distribution from the actual data, can
                  therefore better adapt to the size of the data set,
                  and is more effective in controlling the rate of
                  false discoveries. This work discusses the true
                  potential of RNA-seq for studying regulation at low
                  expression ranges, the noise within RNA-seq data,
                  and the issue of replication.},

                  cell, known as RNA-Seq, generates millions of short
                  sequence fragments in a single run. These fragments,
                  or 'reads', can be used to measure levels of gene
                  expression and to identify novel splice variants of
                  genes. However, current software for aligning
                  RNA-Seq data to a genome relies on known splice
                  junctions and cannot identify novel ones. TopHat is
                  an efficient read-mapping algorithm designed to
                  align reads from an RNA-Seq experiment to a
                  reference genome without relying on known splice
                  sites.We mapped the RNA-Seq reads from a recent
                  mammalian RNA-Seq experiment and recovered more than
                  72\% of the splice junctions reported by the
                  annotation-based software from that study, along
                  with nearly 20,000 previously unreported
                  junctions. The TopHat pipeline is much faster than
                  previous systems, mapping nearly 2.2 million reads
                  per CPU hour, which is sufficient to process an
                  entire RNA-Seq experiment in less than a day on a
                  standard desktop computer. We describe several
                  challenges unique to ab initio splice site discovery
                  from RNA-Seq reads that will require further

                  simultaneous transcript discovery and abundance
                  estimation. However, this would require algorithms
                  that are not restricted by prior gene annotations
                  and that account for alternative transcription and
                  splicing. Here we introduce such algorithms in an
                  open-source software program called Cufflinks. To
                  test Cufflinks, we sequenced and analyzed >430

                  myoblast cell line over a differentiation time

                  3,724 previously unannotated ones, 62\% of which are
                  supported by independent expression data or by
                  homologous genes in other species. Over the time
                  series, 330 genes showed complete switches in the

                  isoform, and we observed more subtle shifts in 1,304
                  other genes. These results suggest that Cufflinks

                  determine the significance of these changes while
                  accounting for the enormous number of genes. We
                  describe a method, Significance Analysis of
                  Microarrays (SAM), that assigns a score to each gene
                  on the basis of change in gene expression relative
                  to the standard deviation of repeated
                  measurements. For genes with scores greater than an
                  adjustable threshold, SAM uses permutations of the
                  repeated measurements to estimate the percentage of
                  genes identified by chance, the false discovery rate
                  (FDR). When the transcriptional response of human
                  cells to ionizing radiation was measured by
                  microarrays, SAM identified 34 genes that changed at
                  least 1.5-fold with an estimated FDR of 12\%,
                  compared with FDRs of 60 and 84\% by using
                  conventional methods of analysis. Of the 34 genes,
                  19 were involved in cell cycle regulation and 3 in
                  apoptosis. Surprisingly, four nucleotide excision

                  platform, we developed DSSS (direct strand specific
                  sequencing), a strand-specific protocol for
                  transcriptome sequencing. We tested DSSS with RNA
                  from two samples, prokaryotic (Mycoplasma
                  pneumoniae) as well as eukaryotic (Mus musculus),
                  and obtained data containing strand-specific
                  information, using single-read and paired-end
                  sequencing.  We validated our results by comparison
                  with a strand-specific tiling array data set for
                  strain M129 of the simple prokaryote M. pneumoniae,
                  and by quantitative PCR (qPCR). The results of DSSS
                  were very well supported by the results from tiling
                  arrays and qPCR. Moreover, DSSS provided higher
                  dynamic range and single-base resolution, thus
                  enabling efficient antisense detection and the
                  precise mapping of transcription start sites and
                  untranslated regions. DSSS data for mouse confirmed

                  applicability of the approach to studying eukaryotic

  abstract =	 {Through alternative processing of pre-messenger
                  RNAs, individual mammalian genes often produce
                  multiple mRNA and protein isoforms that may have
                  related, distinct or even opposing functions. Here
                  we report an in-depth analysis of 15 diverse human
                  tissue and cell line transcriptomes on the basis of
                  deep sequencing of complementary DNA fragments,
                  yielding a digital inventory of gene and mRNA
                  isoform expression. Analyses in which sequence reads
                  are mapped to exon-exon junctions indicated that
                  92-94\% of human genes undergo alternative splicing,
                  86\% with a minor isoform frequency of 15\% or
                  more. Differences in isoform-specific read densities
                  indicated that most alternative splicing and
                  alternative cleavage and polyadenylation events vary
                  between tissues, whereas variation between
                  individuals was approximately twofold to threefold
                  less common. Extreme or 'switch-like' regulation of
                  splicing between tissues was associated with
                  increased sequence conservation in regulatory
                  regions and with generation of full-length open
                  reading frames. Patterns of alternative splicing and
                  alternative cleavage and polyadenylation were
                  strongly correlated across tissues, suggesting
                  coordinated regulation of these processes, and
                  sequence conservation of a subset of known
                  regulatory motifs in both alternative introns and 3'
                  untranslated regions suggested common involvement of
                  specific factors in tissue-level regulation of both
                  splicing and polyadenylation.},

  abstract =	 {The association of genetic variation with disease
                  and drug response, and improvements in nucleic acid
                  technologies, have given great optimism for the
                  impact of 'genomic medicine'. However, the
                  formidable size of the diploid human genome,
                  approximately 6 gigabases, has prevented the routine
                  application of sequencing methods to deciphering
                  complete individual human genomes. To realize the
                  full potential of genomics for human health, this
                  limitation must be overcome. Here we report the DNA
                  sequence of a diploid genome of a single individual,
                  James D. Watson, sequenced to 7.4-fold redundancy in
                  two months using massively parallel sequencing in
                  picolitre-size reaction vessels. This sequence was
                  completed in two months at approximately
                  one-hundredth of the cost of traditional capillary
                  electrophoresis methods. Comparison of the sequence
                  to the reference genome led to the identification of
                  3.3 million single nucleotide polymorphisms, of
                  which 10,654 cause amino-acid substitution within
                  the coding sequence. In addition, we accurately
                  identified small-scale (2-40,000 base pair (bp))
                  insertion and deletion polymorphism as well as copy
                  number variation resulting in the large-scale gain
                  and loss of chromosomal segments ranging from 26,000
                  to 1.5 million base pairs. Overall, these results
                  agree well with recent results of sequencing of a
                  single individual by traditional methods. However,
                  in addition to being faster and significantly less
                  expensive, this sequencing technology avoids the
                  arbitrary loss of genomic sequences inherent in
                  random shotgun sequencing by bacterial cloning
                  because it amplifies DNA in a cell-free system. As a
                  result, we further demonstrate the acquisition of
                  novel human sequence, including novel genes not
                  previously identified by traditional genomic
                  sequencing.  This is the first genome sequenced by
                  next-generation technologies.  Therefore it is a
                  pilot for the future challenges of 'personalized
                  genome sequencing'.},

  abstract =	 {The ability to quantitatively survey the global
                  behavior of transcriptomes has been a key milestone
                  in the field of systems biology, enabled by the
                  advent of DNA microarrays. While this approach has
                  literally transformed our vision and approach to
                  cellular physiology, microarray technology has
                  always been limited by the requirement to decide, a
                  priori, what regions of the genome to examine. While
                  very high density tiling arrays have reduced this
                  limitation for simpler organisms, it remains an
                  obstacle for larger, more complex, eukaryotic
                  genomes.  The recent development of
                  "next-generation" massively parallel sequencing
                  (MPS) technologies by companies such as Roche (454
                  GS FLX), Illumina (Genome Analyzer II), and ABI (AB
                  SOLiD) has completely transformed the way in which
                  quantitative transcriptomics can be done. These new
                  technologies have reduced both the cost-per-reaction
                  and time required by orders of magnitude, making the
                  use of sequencing a cost-effective option for many
                  experimental approaches. One such method that has
                  recently been developed uses MPS technology to
                  directly survey the RNA content of cells, without
                  requiring any of the traditional cloning associated
                  with EST sequencing. This approach, called
                  "RNA-seq", can generate quantitative expression
                  scores that are comparable to microarrays, with the
                  added benefit that the entire transcriptome is
                  surveyed without the requirement of a priori
                  knowledge of transcribed regions. The important
                  advantage of this technique is that not only can
                  quantitative expression measures be made, but
                  transcript structures including alternatively
                  spliced transcript isoforms, can also be
                  identified. This article discusses the experimental
                  approach for both sample preparation and data
                  analysis for the technique of RNA-seq.},

  abstract =	 {Segmental copy-number variations (CNVs) in the human
                  genome are associated with developmental disorders
                  and susceptibility to diseases. More importantly,
                  CNVs may represent a major genetic component of our
                  phenotypic diversity. In this study, using a
                  whole-genome array comparative genomic hybridization
                  assay, we identified 3,654 autosomal segmental CNVs,
                  800 of which appeared at a frequency of at least
                  3\%. Of these frequent CNVs, 77\% are novel. In the
                  95 individuals analyzed, the two most diverse
                  genomes differed by at least 9 Mb in size or varied
                  by at least 266 loci in content. Approximately 68\%
                  of the 800 polymorphic regions overlap with genes,
                  which may reflect human diversity in senses (smell,
                  hearing, taste, and sight), rhesus phenotype,
                  metabolism, and disease
                  susceptibility. Intriguingly, 14 polymorphic regions
                  harbor 21 of the known human microRNAs, raising the
                  possibility of the contribution of microRNAs to
                  phenotypic diversity in humans.  This in-depth
                  survey of CNVs across the human genome provides a
                  valuable baseline for studies involving human
                  genetics.},

                  technology have led to a rapid increase in gene
                  expression data in the form of counts.  RNA-seq can
                  be used for a variety of applications, however,
                  identifying differential expression (DE) remains a
                  key task in functional genomics.  There have been a
                  number of statistical methods for DE detection for
                  RNA-seq data. One common feature of several leading
                  methods is the use of the negative binomial
                  (Gamma-Poisson mixture) model. That is, the
                  unobserved gene expression is modeled by a gamma
                  random variable and, given the expression, the
                  sequencing read counts are modeled as Poisson. The
                  distinct feature in various methods is how the
                  variance, or dispersion, in the Gamma distribution
                  is modeled and estimated.  We evaluate several large
                  public RNA-seq datasets and find that the estimated
                  dispersion in existing methods does not adequately
                  capture the heterogeneity of biological variance
                  among samples. We present a new empirical Bayes
                  shrinkage estimate of the dispersion parameters and
                  demonstrate improved DE detection.},

                  complex variants involving multiple mismatches and
                  long indels. We present computational methods for
                  fast detection of complex variants and splicing in
                  short reads, based on a successively constrained
                  search process of merging and filtering position
                  lists from a genomic index. Our methods are
                  implemented in GSNAP (Genomic Short-read Nucleotide
                  Alignment Program), which can align both single- and
                  paired-end reads as short as 14 nt and of
                  arbitrarily long length. It can detect short- and
                  long-distance splicing, including interchromosomal
                  splicing, in individual reads, using probabilistic
                  models or a database of known splice sites. Our
                  program also permits SNP-tolerant alignment to a
                  reference space of all possible combinations of
                  major and minor alleles, and can align reads from
                  bisulfite-treated DNA for the study of methylation
                  state.In comparison testing, GSNAP has speeds
                  comparable to existing programs, especially in reads
                  of > or=70 nt and is fastest in detecting complex
                  variants with four or more mismatches or insertions
                  of 1-9 nt and deletions of 1-30 nt. Although SNP
                  tolerance does not increase alignment yield
                  substantially, it affects alignment results in 7-8\%
                  of transcriptional reads, typically by revealing
                  alternate genomic mappings for a read. Simulations
                  of bisulfite-converted DNA show a decrease in
                  identifying genomic positions uniquely in 6\% of 36

  abstract =	 {BACKGROUND: DNA copy number variation (CNV) has been
                  recognized as an important source of genetic
                  variation. Array comparative genomic hybridization
                  (aCGH) is commonly used for CNV detection, but the
                  microarray platform has a number of inherent
                  limitations. RESULTS: Here, we describe a method to
                  detect copy number variation using shotgun
                  sequencing, CNV-seq. The method is based on a robust
                  statistical model that describes the complete
                  analysis procedure and allows the computation of
                  essential confidence values for detection of CNV.
                  Our results show that the number of reads, not the
                  length of the reads is the key factor determining
                  the resolution of detection.  This favors the
                  next-generation sequencing methods that rapidly
                  produce large amount of short reads. CONCLUSION:
                  Simulation of various sequencing methods with
                  coverage between 0.1x to 8x show overall specificity
                  between 91.7 - 99.9\%, and sensitivity between 72.2
                  - 96.5\%. We also show the results for assessment of
                  CNV between two individual human genomes.},

  abstract =	 {High throughput methods, such as high density
                  oligonucleotide microarray measurements of mRNA
                  levels, are popular and critical to genome scale
                  analysis and systems biology. However understanding
                  the results of these analyses and in particular
                  understanding the very wide range of levels of
                  transcriptional changes observed is still a
                  significant challenge. Many researchers still use an
                  arbitrary cut off such as two-fold in order to
                  identify changes that may be biologically
                  significant.  We have used a very large-scale
                  microarray experiment involving 72 biological
                  replicates to analyze the response of soybean plants
                  to infection by the pathogen Phytophthora sojae and
                  to analyze transcriptional modulation as a result of
                  genotypic variation.With the unprecedented level of
                  statistical sensitivity provided by the high degree
                  of replication, we show unambiguously that almost
                  the entire plant genome (97 to 99\% of all
                  detectable genes) undergoes transcriptional
                  modulation in response to infection and genetic
                  variation. The majority of the transcriptional
                  differences are less than two-fold in magnitude.  We
                  show that low amplitude modulation of gene
                  expression (less than two-fold changes) is highly
                  statistically significant and consistent across
                  biological replicates, even for modulations of less
                  than 20\%.  Our results are consistent through two
                  different normalization methods and two different
                  statistical analysis procedures.Our findings
                  demonstrate that the entire plant genome undergoes
                  transcriptional modulation in response to infection
                  and genetic variation. The pervasive low-magnitude
                  remodeling of the transcriptome may be an integral
                  component of physiological adaptation in soybean,
                  and in all eukaryotes.},

                  significant signals, such as in screens for
                  differential expression, independent of whether the
                  experimental design incorporates replicates or
                  not. With the compilation of large-scale RNA-Seq
                  datasets with technical replicate samples, however,
                  we can now, for the first time, perform a systematic
                  analysis of the precision of expression level
                  estimates from massively parallel sequencing
                  technology. This then allows considerations for its
                  improvement by computational or experimental
                  means.Results: We report on a comprehensive study of
                  target identification and measurement precision,
                  including their dependence on transcript expression
                  levels, read depth and other parameters. In
                  particular, an impressive recall of 84% of the
                  estimated true transcript population could be
                  achieved with 331 million 50 bp reads, with
                  diminishing returns from longer read lengths and
                  even less gains from increased sequencing
                  depths. Most of the measurement power (75%) is spent
                  on only 7% of the known transcriptome, however,
                  making less strongly expressed transcripts harder to
                  measure. Consequently, <30% of all transcripts could
                  be quantified reliably with a relative error
                  <20%. Based on established tools, we then introduce
                  a new approach for mapping and analysing sequencing
                  reads that yields substantially improved performance
                  in gene expression profiling, increasing the number
                  of transcripts that can reliably be quantified to
                  over 40%.  Extrapolations to higher sequencing
                  depths highlight the need for efficient
                  complementary steps. In discussion we outline
                  possible experimental and computational strategies

  abstract =	 {Using massively parallel sequencing by synthesis
                  methods, we have surveyed the polyA+ transcripts
                  from four stages of the nematode Caenorhabditis
                  elegans to an unprecedented depth. Using novel
                  statistical approaches, we evaluated the coverage of
                  annotated features of the genome and of candidate
                  processed transcripts, including splice junctions,
                  trans-spliced leader sequences, and polyadenylation
                  tracts. The data provide experimental support for
                  >85\% of the annotated protein-coding transcripts in
                  WormBase (WS170) and confirm additional details of
                  processing. For example, the total number of
                  confirmed splice junctions was raised from 70,911 to
                  over 98,000. The data also suggest thousands of
                  modifications to WormBase annotations and identify
                  new spliced junctions and genes not part of any
                  WormBase annotation, including at least 80 putative
                  genes not found in any of three predicted gene
                  sets. The quantitative nature of the data also
                  suggests that mRNA levels may be measured by this
                  approach with unparalleled precision.  Although most
                  sequences align with protein-coding genes, a small
                  fraction falls in introns and intergenic
                  regions. One notable region on the X chromosome
                  encodes a noncoding transcript of >10 kb localized

  abstract =	 {DNA microarray technology typically generates many
                  measurements of which only a relatively small subset
                  is informative for the interpretation of the
                  experiment. To avoid false positive results, it is
                  therefore critical to select the informative genes
                  from the large noisy data before the actual
                  analysis. Most currently available filtering
                  techniques are supervised and therefore suffer from
                  a potential risk of overfitting.  The unsupervised
                  filtering techniques, on the other hand, are either
                  not very efficient or too stringent as they may mix
                  up signal with noise. We propose to use the multiple
                  probes measuring the same target mRNA as repeated
                  measures to quantify the signal-to-noise ratio of
                  that specific probe set. A Bayesian factor analysis
                  with specifically chosen prior settings, which
                  models this probe level information, is providing an
                  objective feature filtering technique, named
                  informative/non-informative calls (I/NI calls).Based
                  on 30 real-life data sets (including various human,
                  rat, mice and Arabidopsis studies) and a spiked-in
                  data set, it is shown that I/NI calls is highly
                  effective, with exclusion rates ranging from 70\% to
                  99\%. Consequently, it offers a critical solution to
                  the curse of high-dimensionality in the analysis of
                  microarray data.This filtering approach is publicly

                  (NGS) data, such as the detection of copy number
                  variations (CNVs), remain challenging. Current
                  methods detect CNVs as changes in the depth of
                  coverage along chromosomes. Technological or genomic
                  variations in the depth of coverage thus lead to a
                  high false discovery rate (FDR), even upon
                  correction for GC content. In the context of
                  association studies between CNVs and disease, a high
                  FDR means many false CNVs, thereby decreasing the
                  discovery power of the study after correction for
                  multiple testing. We propose ‘Copy Number estimation
                  by a Mixture Of PoissonS’ (cn.MOPS), a data
                  processing pipeline for CNV detection in NGS
                  data. In contrast to previous approaches, cn.MOPS
                  incorporates modeling of depths of coverage across
                  samples at each genomic position. Therefore, cn.MOPS
                  is not affected by read count variations along
                  chromosomes. Using a Bayesian approach, cn.MOPS
                  decomposes variations in the depth of coverage
                  across samples into integer copy numbers and noise
                  by means of its mixture components and Poisson
                  distributions, respectively. The noise estimate
                  allows for reducing the FDR by filtering out
                  detections having high noise that are likely to be
                  false detections. We compared cn.MOPS with the five
                  most popular methods for CNV detection in NGS data
                  using four benchmark datasets: (i) simulated data,
                  (ii) NGS data from a male HapMap individual with
                  implanted CNVs from the X chromosome, (iii) data
                  from HapMap individuals with known CNVs, (iv) high
                  coverage data from the 1000 Genomes Project. cn.MOPS
                  outperformed its five competitors in terms of
                  precision (1–FDR) and recall for both gains and
                  losses in all benchmark data sets. The software

                  predominant technique to measure DNA copy number
                  variations (CNVs). However, CNV detection methods
                  for microarrays overestimate both the number and the
                  size of CNV regions and, consequently, suffer from a
                  high false discovery rate (FDR). A high FDR means
                  that many CNVs are wrongly detected and therefore
                  not associated with a disease in a clinical study,
                  though correction for multiple testing takes them
                  into account and thereby decreases the study's
                  discovery power. For controlling the FDR, we propose
                  a probabilistic latent variable model, ‘cn.FARMS’,

                  other sequence-based comparative genomic
                  experiments. RNA-sequencing data take the form of
                  counts, so models based on the Gaussian distribution
                  are unsuitable. Moreover, normalization is
                  challenging because different sequencing experiments
                  may generate quite different total numbers of
                  reads. To overcome these difficulties, we use a
                  log-linear model with a new approach to
                  normalization. We derive a novel procedure to
                  estimate the false discovery rate (FDR). Our method
                  can be applied to data with quantitative, two-class,

                  of our approaches for significance calculation and
                  FDR estimation, and we demonstrate that our method

  abstract =	 {A flexible statistical framework is developed for
                  the analysis of read counts from RNA-Seq gene
                  expression studies. It provides the ability to
                  analyse complex experiments involving multiple
                  treatment conditions and blocking variables while
                  still taking full account of biological
                  variation. Biological variation between RNA samples
                  is estimated separately from the technical variation
                  associated with sequencing technologies. Novel
                  empirical Bayes methods allow each gene to have its
                  own specific variability, even when there are
                  relatively few biological replicates from which to
                  estimate such variability. The pipeline is
                  implemented in the edgeR package of the Bioconductor
                  project. A case study analysis of carcinoma data
                  demonstrates the ability of generalized linear model
                  methods (GLMs) to detect differential expression in
                  a paired design, and even to detect tumour-specific
                  expression changes. The case study demonstrates the
                  need to allow for gene-specific variability, rather
                  than assuming a common dispersion across genes or a
                  fixed relationship between abundance and
                  variability. Genewise dispersions de-prioritize
                  genes with inconsistent results and allow the main
                  analysis to focus on changes that are consistent
                  between biological replicates. Parallel
                  computational approaches are developed to make
                  non-linear model fitting faster and more reliable,
                  making the application of GLMs to genomic data more
                  convenient and practical. Simulations demonstrate
                  the ability of adjusted profile likelihood
                  estimators to return accurate estimators of
                  biological variability in complex situations. When
                  variation is gene-specific, empirical Bayes
                  estimators provide an advantageous compromise
                  between the extremes of assuming common dispersion
                  or separate genewise dispersion. The methods
                  developed here can also be applied to count data
                  arising from DNA-Seq applications, including
                  ChIP-Seq for epigenetic marks and DNA methylation
                  analyses.},

                  associate disease susceptibility with one form of
                  genetic variation, namely, single-nucleotide
                  polymorphisms (SNPs). In recent years, another type
                  of common genetic variation has been characterized,
                  namely, structural variation, including copy number
                  variants (CNVs). To determine the overall
                  contribution of CNVs to complex phenotypes, we have
                  performed association analyses of expression levels
                  of 14,925 transcripts with SNPs and CNVs in
                  individuals who are part of the International HapMap
                  project. SNPs and CNVs captured 83.6\% and 17.7\% of
                  the total detected genetic variation in gene
                  expression, respectively, but the signals from the
                  two types of variation had little
                  overlap. Interrogation of the genome for both types
                  of variants may be an effective way to elucidate the
                  causes of complex phenotypes and disease in humans.},

                  data are under continuous development. Timely review
                  and comparison of the most recently proposed
                  statistical methods will provide a useful guide for

                  edgeR, DESeq, baySeq, and a method with a two-stage

                  simulations that were based on different
                  distribution models or real data. We compared the
                  ability of these methods to detect DE genes in terms
                  of the significance ranking of genes and false
                  discovery rate control. All methods compared are
